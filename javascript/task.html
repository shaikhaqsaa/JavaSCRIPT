<p>Traditional programming is based on low level languages</p>
<p>The Traditional programming languages such as C,C++,and java are compiled.</p>
<p>General programming leads to closed to closed software applications</p>
<p>More code needs  to be written </p>
<p>SCRIPTING :=  A scripting language is a programming language that support scripts</p>
<p>scripting prefers high level languages </p>
<p>Perl,Python,javascript,and other languages used for scripting are interpreted and do not require the compilation step </p>

<h2>what is DOM? explain?</h2>

            if (passData.type == "password") {
                console.log("Inp Pass");
                passData.type = "text"
            }else{

<h2>what is client side & server side?</h2>

<p>There are 3 major types of JavaScript namely:

Server-Side JavaScript (SSJS) -- an extended version of JavaScript that enables back-end access to databases, file systems, and servers

Core JavaScript -- the base JavaScript language

Client-Side JavaScript (CSJS) and Server-Side JavaScript (SSJS) are dependent on the core JavaScript and cannot work without it.</p>

<h2>what is global variable?</h2>
<p>Global Variable: These are variables that are defined in global scope i.e. outside of functions. These variables have global scope, so they can be accessed by any function directly. In the case of global scope variables, the keyword they are declared with does not matter they all act the same. A variable declared without a keyword is also considered global even though it is declared in the function</p>
